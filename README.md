IconFont2Code
===================

This web tool generates a C# class with the Unicode values of the glyph icons in your font file (.ttf/.otf). 

It should be an useful tool for any .NET app (**WPF**/**UWP**/**Xamarin**/**Xamarin.Forms**) which wants to use icon fonts.

In the video below you can see the Foundation icons font which has glyph name in the form of "UniXXXXX":
